## titanic-kaggle-competition-step-by-step-approach-to-get-good-accuracy
Titanic is considered as a very basic kaggle competition, but still getting a score above 90 is still challenging for me.    
Many times I have tried to follow others' approach and still here I am still trying to improve my score.    
So however basic it may be it is a very good project to learn some of the ML concepts    
This time I have kept an excel to keep a track of what I have done and what were the accuracies, so that I can improve upon them. I think this is an excellent which I am sure will help you too. (Let me know what you think of it)    
I will try to keep as simple as it can and also will share links from where I got to learn!    

Lets begin!

Step by step approach to get good score in titanic kaggle competition
Hello friends!
This is an attempt to get good score in titanic kaggle competition.
The approach will be helpful for basic begginers
Following are some of the details that is followed:
1. Using three ML models : RF, LR and XGBoost 
2. Trying different methods of missing value imputation
3. Use of binning
4. Use of Scalers : Minmax/Standard Scalers
5. Feature selection
6. Creating new features from existing features
7. Fine tuning
8. Stacking
9. ...
